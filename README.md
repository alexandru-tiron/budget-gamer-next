## Project Evolution

Budget Gamer started as a vanilla JavaScript project using HTML, CSS, and Firebase services. It has now been completely revamped using modern web technologies to provide a better user experience and more maintainable codebase.

### Key Technology Changes

- **Frontend**: Migrated from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS to Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: Replaced Firebase with:
  - Vercel for hosting and serverless functions
  - Neon DB instead of Firebase Realtime Database
  - tRPC procedures instead of Firebase Functions
- **Styling**: Moved from CSS to Tailwind CSS
- **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- **Database ORM**: Using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **API Layer**: Implemented tRPC for end-to-end type safety

## Features

- üéÆ Track free games across multiple platforms
- üïí Time-limited free game offers
- üéÅ Subscription-based free games (PS Plus, etc.)
- üåô Dark mode support
- üîÑ Regular updates for new free games
- üì± Responsive design for all devices

## Tech Stack
